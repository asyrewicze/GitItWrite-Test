  - How to Deploy Backup Services At Scale
    - Manual rollout via automated/scripted install
    - Does the client install or the MSP?
      - MSP conducting the installation insures correct configuration
      - If client conducts installation the installation and configuration should be idiot-proof and be heavily documented
        - MSP should charge for fixing misconfigurations
    - There is something to be said for choosing a backup vendor that makes rollout simple
    - Can your RMM tool be used to push out backup services?
  - How to do Monitoring and Reporting of Backup Services at Scale
    - This section simply focuses on why any backup application you choose should have rich alerting and reporting features
    - Is there a centralized dashboard that is multi-tenant?
      - Why is this important?
    - Options if you don't have a multi-tenant solution?
      - APIs
      - Event Log collecting
        - Done via VPN (icky)
        - Done via your RMM
    - What happens when an alert comes in?
      - Ticket generated
      - Alert to client POC and MSP
  - How to conduct Backup Maintenance and Patching Operations at Scale
    - Backup maintenance operations should be largely automated via whatever backup tool you select
      - Alerting should be configured for failed maintenance tasks
    - Customers with a higher tier backup package may opt for manual checks by technical staff
  - How to Manage Multiple Backup/DR Operations at Once
    - Dedicated backup instance for each client will make this point moot, it becomes a man power issue at that point
    - Potential snag is when the MSP is the shared offsite location for multiple clients. Care should be given to size disk performance and networking to accommodate multiple restore/backup operations at once
  - How to provide backup access to your customers
    - This section simply talks about self service portals
      - Care should be taken to insure that the chosen solution properly separates tenants data and identities.
      - Who within the client's organization should have access?
        - Technical staff with full access?
        - Client POC with "read-only" access for monitoring and reporting?
          - Any better than the automated reporting and alerting above?
          - This could be a bad idea for needy customers.
  - How to "give back" your customers data if needed
    - Discuss how you may script the offboarding process
    - Is the backup data provided over the network or on disk?
      - If disk is the media shipped in a protected and verifiable fashion?
